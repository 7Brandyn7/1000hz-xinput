Instructions:
1) This script is exclusively compatible with Windows 11.
2) This script must be run as administrator.
3) A computer restart is required after running the script for the changes to take effect.

Disclaimer:
1) After enabling the 1000Hz setting, in certain scenarios, there may be insufficient driver conversion efficiency, resulting in the loss of joystick, trigger, or button data. The eventual result could be operational lag, and triggers or joysticks may not reach their full range. Currently known scenarios that can lead to this phenomenon include:
   a) Run the script in Windows 10.
   b) Run the script in Windows 11 without global timer resolution enabled.
   c) Run the script in Windows 11 with global timer resolution enabled, but the current timer resolution is greater than 1ms (you can use TimerResolution.exe to check the current timer resolution).
2) Enabling global timer resolution may cause system instability, and additional issues are yet to be determined.

File Descriptions:
1) Enable.bat - Enables global timer resolution.
2) Disable.bat - Disables global timer resolution.
